At seventeen, Mitra Rahbar left her homeland due to political unrest. However, she would soon find her way in an unfamiliar land through an ever-deepening prayer life that led her to her soul?s core. Turning outward, she pursued a life of service?first as a social worker and then as a spiritual teacher, healer, and guide. Having worked with students from many walks of life for more than thirty years, Rahbar has a deep understanding of what spiritual seekers long to learn and how best to teach them.In Miraculous Silence, she takes us on a journey into the sacred space of prayer and spiritual healing, providing practical guidance on how to pray and meditate, as well as many of her own prayers to inspire and encourage us. Rahbar also suggests images to visualize and meditate on, mantras to recite in every situation, and stones to aid in the healing process. In these practices, prayers, and inspirations, you will find comfort, illumination, and renewal.'''),

Through spiritual teachings, guided meditations, and inspirational stories of people who discovered loving presence during times of great struggle, Brach invites us to connect more deeply with our own inner life, one another, and the world around us.True Refuge is essential reading for anyone encountering hardship or crisis, anyone dedicated to a path of spiritual awakening.

One by one, women are kidnapped by a serial killer who hopes to mold them into the likeness of his favorite actress, and Jenna knows that it''s only a matter of time before she''s the next victim. Jackson (The Morning After) weaves together various subplots, including Jenna''s relationship with her rebellious teenage daughter and the inevitable love interest with the rugged local cop, to create a fast-paced and surprisingly complex story.

PC Kindle to use for a class and was easy enough to follow along', 'Purchased this book for my PC Kindle to use for a class and was easy enough to follow along. However I will admit I had to reread some sections as it seemed I would miss a key phrase that would throw off the whole section if not done. Lesson learned, use on regular Kindle instead of trying to bounce back and forth. The only thing that would have made it better was a downloadable cheat sheet of the keyboard codes. So often I would have to try to remember that holding two keys would do an action versus using the mouse to find the tool to click on it. That being said, if you have never used Photoshop CC or need a serious refresher this book should be of help. Hoping that they come out with other additions to keep the skills I have learned fresh as a way of practicing while working to finish my degree.'),

The content is great so far.

('978-0679600213', '2002-08-08', '1', '5', '1', '5 stars', 'Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen) has been elevated to star status by the feminists for her independent stance and courage, but don''t read this book because of that. Don''t look for the tragic story of her misguided marriage and the heartbreak and barrenness it brought her, or for descriptions of her love affair with adventurer Denys Finch-Hatton. None of that appears here. Instead, "Out of Africa" is a storytelling book woven in the imaginative Danish style. Dinesen''s finely tuned sensitivity is revealed here, as well as her (again typically Danish) well-developed gift for friendship with many kinds of people. In her case this gift extends to African animals as well, like Lulu, the beautiful gazelle who graced her plantation for years. Her descriptions of the Kenya of her day are exquisitely written, factual and magical at the same time. Africa is the star of the book, not Dinesen herself, not the tribespeople or the colonials, not her struggles with raising coffee in land "a little too high", nor her political dealings with the government officials. Her writing evokes the Africa she knew well and loved deeply.'),
('978-0679600213', '2003-05-08', '1', '4', '1', '4 stars', 'Isak Dinesen''s novel Out of Africa is a recollection of her time spent in Africa while struggling to cope with the immensely different cultures and struggling to run a coffee farm at too high of an altitude. This book is a collection of her stories most of them about her adventures shared with lover Denys Finch-Hatton. Many of the stories are very dangerous, like when they go lion hunting. These stories show the wild side that Dinesen posses. These stories are in no chronological order and at times make the book hard to follow. The best part of the book is the astounding imagery used. The imagery describes the breathtaking views from the on top the Ngong hills and allows you to feel the lack of oxygen, smell the coffee plants and feel the strong African sun beating down upon your skin. The down side to this book is, even after experiencing many adventurers with Dinesen you will probably feel that you do not know much about her personality. This is due to lack of character development since she is telling the story and never describes herself. You do however learn about the struggle she faces being a European woman living in a minority, in a place with very different and diverse cultures. She has to adapt to these cultures and even though she finds her European traditions very different from those of the Africans, she realizes that there is some common ground between the two. Even though this book can be at times hard to follow I highly recommend reading it. The magnificent imagery makes up for the down sides to the book and causes you to realize why Dinesen fell in love with Africa. You will probably find yourself falling in live with Africa and its people just as Dinesen did. A truly remarkable book. '),
('978-0679600213', '2001-12-31', '1', '5', '1', 'After reading this book..', 'After reading this book, Hemingway said in an interview that Dinesen is more deserving of the Nobel prize. It should be remembered that this remark did not come from a modest man, but from someone who was fond of talking about beating Tolstoy in the ring, having defeated Stendhal. Nor, for that matter, was Hemingway known for respecting women.But being a learned and disciplined writer,Hemingway was after all able to appreciate good stuff when he saw it. Literary excellence is rare indeed, and here, in this book, you have it in the unadulterated form. Dinesen undoubtedly had something to say, but more importantly the means--or should I say the genius--to say it. Out of Africa would do very well as a textbook of English prose. Now in some of the other review I found words like "colonial," "racist," "conservationist," and so on. Of course, the reader should not be distracted by these words, but read the book first and form her independent opinion. Meanwhile, my opinion, clearly personal and subjective and limited by my time and place and social class and sex (oops,i mean gender) and whatever you''d like, is that these reviewers don''t know what they are talking about. So buy this book and forget about them. Or if you don''t want to take the risk, borrow it from the library first. Then you''ll want to buy it.'),

Bryson starts out by establishing the longest straight line one can traverse through Great Britain without crossing the sea, dubs it "the Bryson Line" and suggests he will more or less follow this course, then proceeds to do nothing of the sort. By halfway through the book he has merely puttered around the south between London and Cornwall, moving essentially perpendicular to his "line". Along the way he moans about how places he has been decades before have not stayed just the way he remembered (even listing specific hotels and restaurants that are no longer there, like this has any bearing on anything). Occasionally he throws in some weak attempts at humour, but the whole thing comes off an a grumpy old man who forgot where he was going and is generally annoyed that the world has dared to move on. To be fair, I will say that I gave up halfway through the book, maybe the last half is better, but I think I gave it a chance to prove itself, and it failed. '),
